        <h3>About Me: </h3>

        I'm currently a first year student at University of Washington-Seattle, aspiring to become a pediatric nurse. I have over 300 hours of clincial experience working with patients of all ages at Sweedish First Hill, Swedish Cherry Hill, and Edmonds Prestige Rehab Center. 
        During my clinical experience, I've had the chance to talk to all different types of nurses from rehab nurses to oncology nurses. It's been great being able to shadow nurses as well as occupational therapists, physical therapists, 
        doctors and seeing how each person plays such a vital part in an individual's treatment. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn and my next step is working at Seattle Children's as a nursing assistant.
